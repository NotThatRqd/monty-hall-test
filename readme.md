I heard about the Monty Hall problem recently, and I thought it would be fun to write
a program to test it.

If you don't know what the Monty Hall problem is look it up on Google.

Use `cargo run` to run the program.

I am by no means someone who is an expert in this sort of stuff, paradoxes and probability
and whatever (but I find it fascinating), so if you have any suggestions
or corrections please let me know.

I tested it myself, and it seems to work, but I might get around to writing a test for it
at some point. If you want to contribute maybe you could help with that :)

There might be a bug in the logic so let me know if you find one.
